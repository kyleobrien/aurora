My own implementation of Unplayed.

*   Bucketing the past, present and future of my game playing activities.
*   Gameplay notes from the games that I've played.
*   A repository of metadata around the games.

Future Ideas:

*   Track pricing for games I might want to buy.
*   Ability to share or combine your data with others running the same software.
